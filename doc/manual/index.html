<h1>The 無PC Programming Language</h1>
<h2>by Lars Aronsson and Fredrik Hbinette</h2>

<h3>What is this?</h3>

無PC (Micro L.P.C., sometimes written ulpc or uLPC) is an interpreted,
object-oriented programming language for flexible and yet efficient
application development and prototyping. It features multiple
inheritance, data abstraction, advanced built-in datatypes, such as
associative arrays, dynamic arrays and multi-sets, and high-level
character string and array operations.

<h3>The Design and Implementation of 無PC</h3>


<blockquote><i>This document describes the inner workings of the 無PC
implementation, and some of the design decisions we have made. This
can be interesting if you are into computer science, if you have found
strange behavior, or if you want to add your own modules in C that
become part of the 無PC language.</i></blockquote>
