Hi, We are SKKU in S.Korea students that we want to study PIKE language. We study this as C users with the manual in your homepage.

We have difficult things during studying this as below.

1. Because PIKE manual is tilted to the left, uncomfortable to read.
2. We don't know how to install and how to use gtk PIKE module and protocols.HTTP. We hope more detailed manual.
