SSL.File and Stdio.File Emulation Overview
------------------------------------------

Stream:
	The underlying stream object is always in nonblocking
	mode, to avoid risk of hanging in Stdio.Buffer.

Buffering:
	All I/O-ops are always buffered with Stdio.Buffer.

Internal Callback Handling in Nonblocking Mode:
	In nonblocking mode all internal callback handling is
	performed directly with the real_backend.

	If the main backend has been started (ie master()->asyncp()
	is true), we assume that it will handle I/O.
	Otherwise if nonthreaded or we are on the backend thread
	(master()->backend_thread()), we rotate the real_backend
	once with 0.0 timeout per I/O-op.

	Note that this may cause problems when using custom
	backends without having started the main backend.
	Detect?

Internal Callback Handling in Blocking Mode:
	In blocking mode all internal callback handling is
	performed with a dedicated local_backend.

	The local_backend is created when the SSL.File is
	switched to blocking mode.

	The local_backend is then rotated until the blocking
	call is done.

User Callback Handling:
	All user installed callbacks are called via call_out()
	on internal_poll() in the real_backend.

read():
	Get data from user_read_buffer, install ssl_read_callback
	on underflow. In blocking mode rotate the local backend
	until all data is available. In nonblocking mode
	attempt to rotate the local backend once if no callbacks
	are installed.

write():
	Fill write_buffer, install ssl_write_callback.
	In blocking mode rotate the local backend until
	the write_buffer is empty. In nonblocking mode
	attempt to rotate the local backend once if
	no callbacks are installed.

close():
	Schedule a close packet, and block further calls to
	write. If both directions block also further calls
	to read. Install both ssl_write_callback and
	ssl_read_callback and rotate the local backend until
	connection closed from other end, or linger time expires.

destroy()
	Clear user callbacks and switch to nonblocking mode.
	Attempt to send a close packet. Terminate the
	internal_poll() call_out-loop.

ssl_read_callback():
	Decode received data and add it to user_read_buffer.
	Schedule read_callback with real_backend call_out.
	Uninstall on user_read_buffer full.

ssl_write_callback():
	Send data from write_buffer, uninstall on write_buffer empty.
	Schedule write_callback with real_backend call_out.
	On send failure, block futher calls of write.

ssl_close_callback():
	Schedule close_callback if close() has not been called yet.
	Block further calls of read.

ssl_close_alert_callback():
	As ssl_close_callback, but allow use of stream when done.

Known Problems:
	Nonblocking mode without callbacks.

	Support for set_buffer_mode() et al not yet supported,
	neither directly nor in the embedded stream.
