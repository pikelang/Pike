SSL.File and Stdio.File Emulation Overview
------------------------------------------

Stream:
	The underlying stream object is always in nonblocking
	mode, to avoid risk of hanging in Stdio.Buffer.

Buffering:
	All I/O-ops are always buffered with Stdio.Buffer.

Internal Callback Handling in Nonblocking Mode:
	In nonblocking mode all internal callback handling is
	performed directly with the real_backend.

	If the main backend has been started (ie master()->asyncp()
	is true), we assume that it will handle I/O.
	Otherwise if nonthreaded or we are on the backend thread
	(master()->backend_thread()), we rotate the real_backend
	once with 0.0 timeout per I/O-op.

	Note that this may cause problems when using custom
	backends without having started the main backend.
	Detect?

Internal Callback Handling in Blocking Mode:
	In blocking mode all internal callback handling is
	performed with a dedicated local_backend.

	The local_backend is created when the SSL.File is
	switched to blocking mode.

	The local_backend is then rotated until the blocking
	call is done.

User Callback Handling:
	All user installed callbacks are called via call_out()
	on internal_poll() in the real_backend.

read():
	Get data from user_read_buffer, install ssl_read_callback
	on underflow. In blocking mode rotate the local backend
	until all data is available. In nonblocking mode
	attempt to rotate the local backend once if no callbacks
	are installed.

write():
	Fill write_buffer, install ssl_write_callback.
	In blocking mode rotate the local backend until
	the write_buffer is empty. In nonblocking mode
	attempt to rotate the local backend once if
	no callbacks are installed.

close():
	Schedule a close packet, and block further calls to
	write. If both directions block also further calls
	to read. Install both ssl_write_callback and
	ssl_read_callback and rotate the local backend until
	connection closed from other end, or linger time expires.

_destruct()
	Clear user callbacks and switch to nonblocking mode.
	Attempt to send a close packet. Terminate the
	internal_poll() call_out-loop.

ssl_read_callback():
	Decode received data and add it to user_read_buffer.
	Schedule read_callback with real_backend call_out.
	Uninstall on user_read_buffer full.

ssl_write_callback():
	Send data from write_buffer, uninstall on write_buffer empty.
	Schedule write_callback with real_backend call_out.
	On send failure, block futher calls of write.

ssl_close_callback():
	Schedule close_callback if close() has not been called yet.
	Block further calls of read.

ssl_close_alert_callback():
	As ssl_close_callback, but allow use of stream when done.


Known Problems and Missing Features
-----------------------------------

	Nonblocking mode without callbacks.

	Support for set_buffer_mode() et al not yet supported,
	neither directly nor in the embedded stream.

	Session objects should be possible to serialize with
	encode_value() to allow multiple frontend nodes to share the
	session cache. (Overloading the session cache functionality in
	Context is already easy to do)

	The handshake message hash should be streaming and discard raw
	data after each packet. Also, it is probably possible to find
	only one place in the code where data can be fed to the
	streaming hash.

	Currently Pike will always try to maximize the number of bits
	used for certificates, key exchanges, cipher keys and
	hashes. Another popular approach that should be supported is
	to minimize the bits used, above the set threashold. The
	rationale is that everything allowed is good enough and the
	capability negotiation should optimize on consumed resources.

	Servers with different certificates and parameters can sit on
	the same port with different SNI, or with different ALPN. We
	should make it possible to select Context based on negotiation
	(made tricky, as the negotiation depends on the Context).

	It should be possible to lazy load certificates to increase
	startup time and reduce memory usage for servers with many
	sites. Dynamic loading and unloaded could be part of the same
	mechanism as the Context selection mentioned above.

	Truncated HMAC is only supported on the server side. It has
	however been mentioned on the IETF TLS mailing list that there
	are security issues with truncated HMAC, so this is only
	lacking for completeness.

	Ticket-based session resumption is supported on both client-
	and server-side. To avoid security pitfalls, the server-side
	is however by default not state-less. Making it state-less
	can be done by overriding SSL.Context::encode_session() and
	SSL.Context::decode_session() with a suitable encoding.
