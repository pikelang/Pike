#  Mors dag firas den sista söndagen i maj. Mors dag lanserades 1905
#  av den amerikanska lärarinnan Ann Jarvis och firades första gången
#  i USA andra söndagen i maj 1907.I Sverige togs traditionen upp 1919
#  på initiativ av Cecilia Bååth - Holmberg, som flyttade det till
#  sista söndagen i maj. 1920 gav hon ut en handledning om hur man
#  skulle fira Mors dag. Det är inte många fester som tillkommit genom
#  att någon talat om hur firandet skall gå till. I våra dagar har de
#  kommersiella intressena tagit över, men många mödrar får
#  fortfarande kaffe på sängen och bjuds på middag och blommor.
