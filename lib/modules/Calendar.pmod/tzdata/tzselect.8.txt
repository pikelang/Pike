tzselect(8)                 System Manager's Manual                tzselect(8)

NAME
       tzselect - select a timezone

SYNOPSIS
       tzselect [ -c coord ] [ -n limit ] [ --help ] [ --version ]

DESCRIPTION
       The tzselect program asks the user for information about the current
       location, and outputs the resulting timezone to standard output.  The
       output is suitable as a value for the TZ environment variable.

       All interaction with the user is done via standard input and standard
       error.

OPTIONS
       -c coord
              Instead  of asking for continent and then country and then city,
              ask for selection from  time  zones  whose  largest  cities  are
              closest  to  the  location  with geographical coordinates coord.
              Use ISO 6709 notation for coord, that is, a latitude immediately
              followed by a longitude.  The latitude and longitude  should  be
              signed  integers  followed  by  an  optional  decimal  point and
              fraction: positive numbers represent north  and  east,  negative
              south  and  west.   Latitudes with two and longitudes with three
              integer digits are treated as degrees; latitudes  with  four  or
              six and longitudes with five or seven integer digits are treated
              as  DDMM,  DDDMM,  DDMMSS,  or  DDDMMSS  representing  DD or DDD
              degrees, MM minutes, and zero or SS seconds, with  any  trailing
              fractions  represent  fractional  minutes  or (if SS is present)
              seconds.  The decimal point is that of the current locale.   For
              example, in the (default) C locale, -c +40.689-074.045 specifies
              40.689 degrees N, 74.045 degrees W, -c +4041.4-07402.7 specifies
              40  degrees  41.4  minutes  N,  74  degrees  2.7  minutes W, and
              -c +404121-0740240 specifies 40 degrees 41 minutes 21 seconds N,
              74 degrees 2 minutes 40 seconds W.  If coord is not one  of  the
              documented forms, the resulting behavior is unspecified.

       -n limit
              When  -c  is  used, display the closest limit locations (default
              10).

       --help Output help information and exit.

       --version
              Output version information and exit.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       AWK    Name of a POSIX-compliant awk program (default: awk).

       TZDIR  Name of the directory containing timezone data  files  (default:
              /usr/share/zoneinfo).

FILES
       TZDIR/iso3166.tab
              Table of ISO 3166 2-letter country codes and country names.

       TZDIR/zone1970.tab
              Table  of  country codes, latitude and longitude, timezones, and
              descriptive comments.

       TZDIR/TZ
              Timezone data file for timezone TZ.

EXIT STATUS
       The exit status is zero if a timezone was  successfully  obtained  from
       the user, nonzero otherwise.

       user's political preferences.
