//! This module serves as a front-end to different kinds of caching systems.
//! It uses two helper objects to actually store data, and to determine
//! expiration policies. Mechanisms to allow for distributed caching systems
//! will be added in time, or at least that is the plan.

/*
 * Miscellaneous thoughts.
 *
 * Some kind of settings-system will be needed, at least for the policy
 * manager. Maybe having a couple of pass-throught functions here might help.
 *
 * Data-objects should really be created by the Storage Manager, which can
 * then choose to use specialized forms (i.e. using some SQL tricks to
 * perform lazy work).
 *
 * I chose to go with call_outs for the cleanup cycle, and start a new thread
 * if possible when doing
 * cleanup. I have mixed feelings for this choice. On one side, it is quite
 * cheap and easily implemented. On the other side, it restricts us to
 * async mode, and creating a new thread can be not-so-cheap.
 *
 * It would be nice to have some statistics collection. But for some kind of
 * stats the storage manager has to be involved (if any kind of efficiency
 * is desired). However if we wish to do so, either we extend the storage
 * manager's API, or we're in trouble.
