Changes since Pike 7.6:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o New syntax to index from the end in range operations.
  A "<" can be added before an index in the [..] operator to count
  from the end instead. This is convenient to e.g. chop off the last
  element in an array: a[..<1].

o Several declarations and definitions (most notably the debug and
  runtime flags) have moved from main.h to pike_embed.h, in an attempt
  to add support for embedding.

o New `[..] operator function.
  Range operations have been separated from the `[] operator function
  and is handled by a new `[..] which provides greater control in how
  the range bounds are specified. For compatibility, if there is no
  `[..] then `[] is still called for range operations.

o Generalized this and this_program.
  It is now possible to refer to inherits in objects. Example:
    class A {
      int a;
      void foo() { werror("A\n"); }
    }
    class B {
      inherit A;
      int b;
      void foo() { werror("B\n"); }
      A::this_program get_a() { return A::this; }
    }
  In the above B()->get_a() will return an object with two symbols,
  'a' and 'foo', but B()->get_a()->foo() will still write "B\n".

o Unicode escapes.
  Pike now understands the common way to escape unicode chars, using
  \uxxxx and \Uxxxxxxxx escapes. These escapes works both in string
  and character literals and in the preprocessor. The latter means
  that unicode escapes can be used in identifiers, which is useful if
  they contain characters that can't be represented raw in the source
  code charset.

o Stdio.*
  Stdio.cp can now work recursively in a directory tree.
  Stdio.cp now keeps permissions when copying.
  Added Stdio.recursive_mv which works on every OS and also when the
  destination isn't on the same filesystem as the source.

o Process.popen
   Process.popen is now able to run in nonblocking mode. If a second
   argument is provided a file object will be opened with that mode
   and return, enabling two way communication with the new process.

o bin/precompile.pike
   Voidable pointer types are no longer promoted to mixed.

o PIKE_PORTABLE_BYTECODE
   --with-portable-bytecode is now the default. Pike programs that have
   been dumped on one architecture now can be decoded on another.

o Math.Matrix 
  Multiplication were bugged and gave B*A instead of A*B. Now fixed. 

o Destruct reason passed to lfun::destroy.
  lfun::destroy now receives an integer flag that tells why the object
  is being destructed, e.g. if it was an explicit call to destroy(),
  running out of references, or reaped by the garbage collector.

  These integers are defined in the new Object module as
  DESCTRUCT_EXPLICIT, DESTRUCT_NO_REFS, DESTRUCT_GC and
  DESTRUCT_CLEANUP.

o Unicode
  Case information and the Unicode module are updated to Unicode
  5.0.0.


Extensions and New Functions

o Calendar.Badi
  Support for the Badi calendar used in the Baha'i religion.

New Modules

o ADT.Set
  ADT.Set implements a datatype for sets. These sets behave much
  like multisets, except that they are restricted to containing only
  one instance of each member value.

  From a performance viewpoint, it is probably more efficient for a
  Pike program to use mappings to serve as sets, rather than using an
  ADT.Set,so ADT.Set is mainly provided for the sake of completeness
  and code readability.

o Protocols.DNS_SD
  This module provides an interface to DNS Service Discovery. The
  functionality of DNS-SD is described at <http://www.dns-sd.org/>.

  Using the Proctocols.DNS_SD.Service class a Pike program can
  announce services, for example a web site or a database server, to
  computers on the local network.

  When registering a service you need to provide the service name.
  service type, domain and port number. You can also optionally
  specify a TXT record. The contents of the TXT record varies between
  different services; for example, a web server can announce a path
  to a web page, and a printer spooler is able to list printer
  features such as color support or two-sided printing.

  The service is registered on the network for as long as the instance
  of the Service class is valid.

o Bittorrent.Tracker
  Bittorrent tracker with support for scraping and UDP extension.

o Protocols.HTTP.Server.Proxy
  A simple HTTP proxy.

o Standards.TLD
  Country domains and other TLDs according to IANA. Useful when
  parsing log information or providing live information about clients
  connecting to your server.

o Tools.Shoot
  Several new tests have been added to benchmark and improve on
  various aspects of Pike. ReplaceParallel and ReplaceSerial compares
  the time it takes to replace multiple substrings of a string in a
  single call to replace and with subsequent calls.

  TagRemoveArraySscanf, TagRemoveDivide, TagRemoveLoop,
  TagRemoveParserHTML, TagRemovePCRE, TagRemoveSearch and
  TagRemoveSscanf compares different methods of completing the same
  task, to remove XML tags from a string.

o Web.CGI
  Provides a CGI interface on the callee side. Retrieves information
  from environment variables and populates the variables in the
  Request object.

New lib:
Protocols.LDAP module.pmod
Sql.Sql dsn
        sqlite
        sql_array_result
        sql_object_result
        tds

Charset gb18030
        gbk
Parser c.c / pike.c

Incompatible changes

  These incompatible changes can be solved by adding #pike 7.6 to your
  source file or starting Pike with -V7.6.

o Array.transpose_old
  This function is removed.

o _Charset
  This internal module has had most of its content removed.

o Debug.describe_program
  The API for this debug function has changed.

o Image.Image
  The functions select_colors(), map_closest(), map_fast() and
  map_fs() has been removed. Use Image.Colortable operations instead.

o Parser.XML
  The XML parsers are now stricter in verifying the correctness
  of the XML. The function compat_allow_errors can be called in the
  create method of the Parser.XML.Simple and Parser.XML.Validating
  (with "7.6" as argument for 7.6 compatibility). Parser.XML.Tree can
  be created with PARSE_COMPAT_ALLOW_ERRORS_7_6 as flag.

o Protocols.LDAP.client
  The "dn" field wasn't properly utf-8 decoded in 7.6 and earlier. If
  your application does it yourself, you need to use the compatibility
  version of this class.

o spider.XML
  The spider module no longer contains the XML parser. The functions
  isbasechar(), iscombiningchar(), isdigit(), isextender(),
  isfirstnamechar(), ishexchar(), isidiographic(), isletter(),
  isnamechar() and isspace() has also been moved to the Parser module.

o Sql.Sql
  Pike will no longer create a .column entry in SQL query responses if
  there is no table name.

o Standards.UUID
  Functions new() and new_string() has been removed. Use
  make_version1(-1)->encode() and make_version1(-1)->str() instead.

o Stdio
  The functions read_file(), read_bytes(), write_file() and
  append_file() now always throw errors upon errors, to allow easier
  use as errno doesn't have to be checked. read_file() and
  read_bytes() still returns 0 if the file does not exists.
