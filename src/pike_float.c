 * For normal numbers, the format follows the standard programming
 * language format, i.e. [-]ddd[.ddd][eÂ±ddd] in base 10, where either
 * a decimal point or an exponent always is present. The integer part
 * starts with a zero only if it is zero.

   *
   * o  Using sprintf makes us susceptible to locale differences
   *    (affects the decimal separator, but nothing else).
   *
   * o  Temporarily changing the locale is not thread safe.
   *
   * o  Rolling an own formatter is not sufficiently trivial,
   *    considering how complicated the one in glibc is. Even if the
   *    code is ripped from somewhere, the risk of subtle formatting
   *    bugs is prohibitive.
   *
   * The conclusion is to use sprintf anyway and replace the decimal
   * separator afterwards.
