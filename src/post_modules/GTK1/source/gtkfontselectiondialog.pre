//! The GtkFontSelectionDialog widget is a dialog box for selecting a font.
//! <p>
//! To set the font which is initially selected, use set_font_name().
//! </p><p>
//! To get the selected font use get_font() or get_font_name().
//! </p><p>
//! To change the text which is shown in the preview area, use
//! set_preview_text().

//! Filters can be used to limit the fonts shown. There are 2 filters in
//! the GtkFontSelectionDialog - a base filter and a user filter. The
//! base filter can not be changed by the user, so this can be used when
//! the user must choose from the restricted set of fonts (e.g. for a
//! terminal-type application you may want to force the user to select a
//! fixed-width font). The user filter can be changed or reset by the
//! user, by using the 'Reset Filter' button or changing the options on
//! the 'Filter' page of the dialog.
