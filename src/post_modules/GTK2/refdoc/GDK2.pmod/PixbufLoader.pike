GDK2.Pixbuf get_pixbuf( );
// Queries the GdkPixbuf that a pixbuf loader is currently
// creating. In general it only makes sense to call this function
// after the "area-prepared" signal has been emitted by the loader;
// this means that enough data has been read to know the size of the
// image that will be allocated.
//
// If the loader has not received
// enough data via @[write](), then this function
// returns NULL. The returned pixbuf will be the same in all future
// calls to the loader, so you can just keep it around. Additionally,
// if the loader is an animation, it will return the "static image"
// of the animation (see @[GDK2.PixbufAnimation.get_static_image]).

GDK2.PixbufLoader set_size( int width, int height );
//! Causes the image to be scaled while it is loaded. Attempts to set

//!

int(0..1) write( string|Stdio.Buffer data );
//! This will cause a pixbuf loader to parse the more data for
//! an image. It will return TRUE if the data was loaded successfully,
//! and FALSE if an error occurred. In the latter case, the loader
//! will be closed, and will not accept further writes.
