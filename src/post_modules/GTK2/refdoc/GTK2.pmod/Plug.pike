//! Together with W(Socket), GTK2.Plug provides the ability to embed
//! widgets from one process into another process in a fashion that is
//! transparent to the user. One process creates a W(Socket) widget
//! and, passes the XID of that widgets window to the other process,
//! which then creates a GTK2.Plug window with that XID. Any widgets
//! contained in the GTK2.Plug then will appear inside the first
//! applications window.
