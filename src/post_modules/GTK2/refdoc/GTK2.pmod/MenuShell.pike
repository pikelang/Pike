//! A GTK2.MenuShell is the abstract base class used to derive the
//! W(Menu) and W(MenuBar) subclasses.
//! 
//! A GTK2.MenuShell is a container of W(MenuItem) objects arranged in a
//! list which can be navigated, selected, and activated by the user to
//! perform application functions. A W(MenuItem) can have a submenu
//! associated with it, allowing for nested hierarchical menus.
//! 
//!
//!
//!  Signals:
//! @b{activate_current@}
//! An action signal that activates the current menu item within the
//! menu shell.
//!
//!
//! @b{cancel@}
//! An action signal which cancels the selection within the menu
//! shell.  Causes the selection-done signal to be emitted.
//!
//!
//! @b{cycle_focus@}
//!
//! @b{deactivate@}
//! This signal is emitted when a menu shell is deactivated.
//!
//!
//! @b{move_current@}
//! An action signal which moves the current menu item in the direction
//! specified.
//!
//!
//! @b{move_selected@}
//!
//! @b{selection_done@}
//! This signal is emitted when a selection has been completed within a
//! menu shell.
