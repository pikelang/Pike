GTK2.TreePath convert_child_path_to_path( GTK2.TreePath child_path );
//! Converts child_path to a path relative to this model.  That is,
//! child_path points to a path in the child mode.  The returned path will
//! point to the same row in the sorted model.

GTK2.TreePath convert_path_to_child_path( GTK2.TreePath sorted_path );

GTK2.TreeModelSort reset_default_sort_func( );
//! This resets the default sort function to be in the 'unsorted' state.
//! That is, it is in the same order as the child model.  It will re-sort the
