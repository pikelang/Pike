//!
//!

mapping get_position( );
//! This function returns the position you need to pass to move() to keep this
//! window in its current position.  This means that the meaning of the
//! returned value varies with window gravity.
//! 
//! If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
//! GDK2.GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST.  This means that get_position() gets the position
//! of the top-left corner of the window manager frame for the window.  move()
//! sets the position of this same top-left corner.
//! 
//! get_position() is not 100% reliable because X does not specify a way to
//! obtain the geometry of the decorations placed on a window by the window
//! manager.  Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that works with most window
//! managers.
//! 
//! Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with respect
//! to their handling of window gravity.  So moving a window to its current
//! position as returned by get_position() tends to result in moving the window
//! slightly.  Window managers are slowly getting better over time.
//! 
//! If a window has gravity GDK2.GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager frame is not
//! relevant, and thus get_position() will always produc accurate results.
//! However you can't use static gravity to do things like place a window in a
//! corner of the screen, because static gravity ignores the window manager
//! decorations.
//! 
//! If you are saving and restoring your application's window positions, you
//! should know that it's impossible for applications to do this without
//! getting it somewhat wrong because applications do not have sufficient
//! knowledge of window manager state.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window get_resizable( );
//! Gets the whether this window is resizable.
//!
//!

mapping get_size( );
//! Obtains the current size of window.

GTK2.Window get_transient_for( );
//! Fetches the transient parent for this window.

//!

int get_type_hint( );
//! Gets the type hint.
//!
//!

int get_urgency_hint( );
//! Gets the value set by set_urgency_hint().
//!
//!

int has_toplevel_focus( );
//! Returns whether the input focus is within this window.  For real toplevel
//! windows, this is identical to is_active(), but for embedded windows, like
//! W(Plug), the results will differ.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window iconify( );
//! Asks to iconify (minimize) this window.  Note that you shouldn't
//! assume the window is definitely iconified afterward, because other
//! entities (e.g. the user or window manager) could deiconify it again,
//! or there may not be a window manager in which case iconification isn't
//! possible, etc.
//!
//!

int is_active( );
//! Returns whether the window is part of the current active toplevel.  (That
//! is, the toplevel window receiving keystrokes.)  The return value is true
//! if the window is active toplevel itself, but also if it is, say, a W(Plug)
//! embedded in the active toplevel.  You might use this function if you wanted
//! to draw a widget differently in an active window from a widget in an
//! inactive window().
//!
//!

GTK2.Window lower( );
//! Lower this window if the window manager allows that.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window maximize( );
//! Maximize a window.  Same caveats as iconify().

int mnemonic_activate( int keyval, int modifier );
//! Activates the targets associated with the mnemonic.  modifier is one of

//! GDK2.MOD2_MASK, GDK2.MOD3_MASK, GDK2.MOD4_MASK, GDK2.MOD5_MASK,

//! GDK2.BUTTON5_MASK, GDK2.RELEASE_MASK, GDK2.MODIFIER_MASK
//!
//!

GTK2.Window move( int x, int y );
//! Asks the window manage to move the window to the given position.  Window
//! managers are free to ignore this; most window managers ignore request for
//! initial window positions (instead using a user-defined placement algorithm)
//! and honor requests after the window has already been shown.
//! 
//! Note: the position is the position of the gravity-determined reference
//! point for the window.  The gravity determines two things: first, the
//! location of the reference point in root window coordinates; and second,
//! which point on the window is position at the reference point.
//! 
//! By default the gravity is GDK2.GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, so the reference point is
//! simply the x,y supplied to move().  The top-left corner of the window
//! decorations (aka window frame or border) will be place at x,y.  Therefore,
//! to position a window at the top left of the screen, you want to use the
//! default gravity (which is GDK2.GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to
//! 0,0.
//! 
//! To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you would
//! set GDK2.GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST, which means that the reference point is at
//! x + the window width and y + the window height, and the bottom-right corner
//! of the window border will be placed at that reference point.
//!
//!

int parse_geometry( string geometry );
//! Parses a standard X geometry string.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window present( );
//! Presents this window to the user.  This may mean raising the window
//! in the stacking order, deiconifying it, moving it to the current
//! desktop, and/or giving it the keyboard focus, possibly dependent
//! on the user's platform, window manager, and preferences.
//! 
//! If hidden, it calls show() as well.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window present_with_time( int timestamp );
//! Presents a window to the user with a timestamp.  See present().
//!
//!

GTK2.Window raise( );
//! Raise this window if the window manager allows that.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window remove_accel_group( GTK2.AccelGroup group );
//! Reverses the effects of add_accel_group().
//!
//!

GTK2.Window remove_mnemonic( int keyval, GTK2.Widget target );
//! Removes a mnemonic from this window.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window reshow_with_initial_size( );
//! Hides the window, then reshows it, resetting the default size and position
//! of the window.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window resize( int width, int height );
//! Resizes the window as if the user had done so, obeying geometry 
//! constraints.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_accept_focus( int setting );
//! Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to receive the
//! input focus.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_decorated( int setting );
//! Add title bar, resize controls, etc.
//! Default is true, so you may only need to use this function if
//! you want to remove decorations.  Depending on the system, this
//! function may not have any effect when called on a window that is
//! already visible, so you should call it before calling show().
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_default( GTK2.Widget child );
//! The default widget is the widget that's activated when the user presses
//! Enter in a dialog (for example).  This function sets or unsets the default
//! widget.  When setting (rather than unsetting) the default widget it's
//! generally easier to call GTK2.Widget->grab_default() on the widget.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_default_size( int width, int height );
//! Sets the default size of a window.  If the window's "natural" size (its
//! size request) is larger than the default, the default will be ignored.
//! more generally, if the default size does not obey the geometry hints for
//! the window (set_geometry_hints() can be used to set these explicitly), the
//! default size will be clamped to the nearest permitted size.
//! 
//! Unlike set_size_request(), which sets a size request for a widget and thus
//! would keep users from shrinking the window, this function only sets the
//! initial size, just as if the user had resized the window themselves.  Users
//! can still shrink the window again as they normally would.  Setting a
//! default size of -1 means to use the "natural" default size (the size
//! request of the window).
//! 
//! For more control over a window's initial size and how resizing works,
//! investigate set_geometry_hints().
//! 
//! For some uses, resize() is a more appropriate function.  resize() changes
//! the current size of the window, rather than the size to be used on initial
//! display.  resize() always affects the window itself, not the geometry
//! widget.
//! 
//! The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is shown;
//! if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size it had prior
//! to hiding, rather than using the default size.
//! 
//! Window scan't actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
//! passing 0 for width and height is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_deletable( int setting );
//! By default, windows have a close button in the window frame.  Some
//! window managers allow GTK+ to disable this button.  If you set the
//! deletable property to FALSE using this function, GTK+ will do its best
//! to convince the window manager not to show a close button.  Depending
//! on the system, this function may not have any effect when called on a
//! window that is already visible, so you should call it before calling
//! show().
//! 
//! On Windows, this function always works, since there's no window manager
//! policy involved.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_destroy_with_parent( int setting );
//! If setting is true, then destroying the transient parent of this window
//! will also destroy the window itself.  This is useful for dialogs that
//! shouldn't persist beyond the lifetime of the main window they're associated
//! with, for example.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_focus( GTK2.Widget child );
//! If child is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets it as the
//! focus widget for the window.  If child is 0, unsets the focus widget for
//! this window.  To set the focus to a particular widget in the toplevel, it
//! is usually more convenient to use GTK2.Widget->grab_focus() instead of this
//! function.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_focus_on_map( int setting );
//! Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to receive the
//! input focus when the window is mapped.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_geometry_hints( GTK2.Widget widget, mapping geometry );
//! This function sets up hints about how a window can be resized by the user.
//! You can set a minimum and maximum size; allowed resized increments (e.g.
//! for xterm, you can only resize by the size of a character); aspect ratios;
//! and more.
//! geometry is a mapping with the following fields.  Any field which is
//! omitted is left as the default:
//! ([ "min_width": int,
//!    "min_height": int,
//!    "max_width": int,
//!    "max_height": int,
//!    "base_width": int,
//!    "base_height": int,
//!    "width_inc": int,
//!    "height_inc": int,
//!    "min_aspect": float,
//!    "max_aspect": float,
//!    "win_gravity": int, @[GDK_GRAVITY_CENTER], @[GDK_GRAVITY_EAST], @[GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH], @[GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_EAST], @[GDK_GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST], @[GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH], @[GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH_EAST], @[GDK_GRAVITY_SOUTH_WEST], @[GDK_GRAVITY_STATIC] and @[GDK_GRAVITY_WEST]
//! ]);
//! min_width/min_height/max_width/max_height may be set to -1, and it will
//! substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget.  If the
//! minimum size hint is not provided, it will use its requisition as the
//! minimum size.  If the minimum size is provided and a geometry widget is
//! set, it will take the minimum size as the minimum size of the geometry
//! widget rather than the entire window.  The base size is treat similarly.
//! min_width: minimum width of the window (-1 to use requisition)
//! min_height: minimum height of window (-1 to use requisition)
//! max_width: maximum width of window (-1 to use requisition)
//! max_height: maximum height of window (-1 to use requisition)
//! base_width: allow window widths are base_width+width_inc*N (-1 allowed)
//! base_height: allowed window widths are base_height+height_inc*N (-1 allowed)
//! width_inc: width resize increment
//! height_inc: height resize increment
//! min_aspect: minimum width/height ratio
//! max_aspect: maximum width/height ratio
//! win_gravity: window gravity
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_gravity( int gravity );
//! Window gravity defines the meaning of coordinates passed to move().
//! 
//! The default window gravity is GDK2.GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST, which will typically
//! "do what you mean."
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_icon( GDK2.Pixbuf icon );
//! Sets up the icon representing this window.  This icon is used when the
//! window is minimized (also know as iconified).  Some window managers or
//! desktop environments may also place it in the window frame, or display it
//! in other contexts.
//! 
//! The icon should be provided in whatever size it was naturally drawn; that
//! is, don't scale the image before passing it.  Scaling is postponed until
//! the last minute, when the desired final size is known, to allow best
//! quality.
//! 
//! If you have your icon hand-drawn in multiple sizes, use set_icon_list().
//! Then the best size will be used.
//!
//!

int set_icon_from_file( string filename );
//! Sets the icon from a file.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_icon_list( array list );
//! Set up the icons for minimizing.
//! 
//! set_icon_list() allows you to pass in the same icon in several hand-drawn
//! sizes.  The list should contain the natural sizes your icon is avilable in;
//! that is, don't scale the image before passing it.  Scaling is postponed
//! until the last minute, when the desired final size is known, to allow best
//! quality.
//! 
//! By passing several sizes, you may improve the final image quality of the
//! icon, by reducing or eliminating automatic image scaling.
//! 
//! Recommended sizes to provide: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 at minimum, and larger
//! images (64x64, 128x128) if you have them.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_icon_name( string name );
//! Sets the icon for the window from a named themed icon.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_keep_above( int setting );
//! Keep window above.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_keep_below( int setting );
//! Keep window below.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_mnemonic_modifier( int modifier );
//! Sets the mnemonic modifer for this window.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_modal( int setting );
//! Sets a window modal or non-modal.  Modal windows prevent interaction with
//! other windows in the same application.  To keep modal dialogs on top of
//! main application windows, use set_transient_for() to make the dialog
//! transient for the parent; most window managers will then disallow lowering
//! the dialog below the parent.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_opacity( float opacity );
//! Request the windowing system to make this window partially transparent,
//! with opacity 0 being full transparent and 1 fully opaque.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_position( int pos );
//! Sets a position contraint for this window.  If the old or new constraint
//! is GTK2.WIN_POS_CENTER_ALWAYS, this will also cause the window to be
//! repositioned to satisfy the new constraint.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_resizable( int setting );
//! Sets whether the user can resize a window.  Windows are user resizable by
//! default.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_skip_pager_hint( int setting );
//! Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to display the
//! window in the pager.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_skip_taskbar_hint( int setting );
//! Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment not to display the
//! window in the task bar.  This function sets this hint.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_startup_id( string id );
//! Startup notification identifiers are used by desktop environment to 
//! track application startup, to provide user feedback and other features. 
//! This function changes the corresponding property on the underlying 
//! GDK2.Window. Normally, startup identifier is managed automatically and 
//! you should only use this function in special cases like transferring 
//! focus from other processes. You should use this function before 
//! calling window->present() or any equivalent function generating a 
//! window map event.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_title( string title );
//! Set the window title. The default title is the value sent to
//! setup_gtk, or if none is sent, Pike GTK.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_transient_for( GTK2.Window parent );
//! Dialog window should be set transient for the main application window they
//! were spawned from.  This allows window managers to e.g. keep the dialog on
//! top of the main window, or center the dialog over the main window.
//! W(Dialog) and other convenience objects in GTK+ will sometimes call
//! set_transient_for on your behalf.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_type_hint( int hint );
//! Set type of window.  Values are @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_DESKTOP], @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_DIALOG], @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_DOCK], @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_MENU], @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_NORMAL], @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_SPLASHSCREEN], @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_TOOLBAR] and @[GDK_WINDOW_TYPE_HINT_UTILITY]
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_urgency_hint( int setting );
//! Windows may set a hint asking the desktop environment to draw the users
//! attention to the window.  This function sets this hint.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window set_wmclass( string name, string class );
//! Set the window manager application name and class.
//!
//!

GTK2.Window stick( );
//! Makes this window sticky.  Same caveats as iconify().
//!
//!

GTK2.Window unfullscreen( );
//! Opposite of fullscreen().
