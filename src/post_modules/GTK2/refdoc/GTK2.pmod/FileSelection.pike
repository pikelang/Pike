//! GtkFileSelection should be used to retrieve file or directory names
//! from the user. It will create a new dialog window containing a
//! directory list, and a file list corresponding to the current
//! working directory. The filesystem can be navigated using the
//! directory list, the drop-down history menu, or the TAB key can be
//! used to navigate using filename completion common in text based
//! editors such as emacs and jed.
//! 
//! The default filename can be set using set_filename() and the
//! selected filename retrieved using get_filename().
//! 
//! Use complete() to display files that match a given pattern. This
//! can be used for example, to show only *.txt files, or only files
//! beginning with gtk*.
//! 
//! Simple file operations; create directory, delete file, and rename
//! file, are available from buttons at the top of the dialog. These
//! can be hidden using hide_fileop_buttons() and shown again using
//! show_fileop_buttons().

GTK2.FileSelection complete( string pattern );
//! Will attempt to match pattern to a valid filename in the current
//! directory. If a match can be made, the matched filename will appear
//! in the text entry field of the file selection dialog. If a partial
//! match can be made, the "Files" list will contain those file names
//! which have been partially matched.
//!
//!

protected void create( void title_or_props );
//! Creates a new file selection dialog box. By default it will list
//! the files in the current working directory. Operation buttons
//! allowing the user to create a directory, delete files, and rename
//! files will also be present by default.

//! based on GTK2.FileSelection.
//!
//!

GTK2.FileSelection set_filename( string fname );
//! Sets a default path for the file requestor. If filename includes a
//! directory path, then the requestor will open with that path as its

//! Sets whether the user is allowed to select multiple files.
