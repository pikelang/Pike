//! Activates the current focused widget.

int activate_default();
//! Activates the default widget, unless the current focused widget has been
//! configured to receive the default action, in which case the focuses widget
//! is activated.

void set_modal(int setting);
//! Sets a window modal or non-modal.  Modal windows prevent interaction with
//! other windows in the same application.  To keep modal dialogs on top of
//! main application windows, use set_transient_for() to make the dialog
//! transient for the parent; most window managers will then disallow lowering
//! the dialog below the parent.

void set_default_size(int width, int height);
//! Sets the default size of a window.  If the window's "natural" size (its
//! size request) is larger than the default, the default will be ignored.
//! more generally, if the default size does not obey the geometry hints for
//! the window (set_geometry_hints() can be used to set these explicitly), the
//! default size will be clamped to the nearest permitted size.
//! <p>
//! Unlike set_size_request(), which sets a size request for a widget and thus
//! would keep users from shrinking the window, this function only sets the
//! initial size, just as if the user had resized the window themselves.  Users
//! can still shrink the window again as they normally would.  Setting a
//! default size of -1 means to use the "natural" default size (the size
//! request of the window).
//! <p>
//! For more control over a window's initial size and how resizing works,
//! investigate set_geometry_hints().
//! <p>
//! For some uses, resize() is a more appropriate function.  resize() changes
//! the current size of the window, rather than the size to be used on initial
//! display.  resize() always affects the window itself, not the geometry
//! widget.
//! <p>
//! The default size of a window only affects the first time a window is shown;
//! if a window is hidden and re-shown, it will remember the size it had prior
//! to hiding, rather than using the default size.
//! <p>
//! Window scan't actually be 0x0 in size, they must be at least 1x1, but
//! passing 0 for width and height is OK, resulting in a 1x1 default size.

//! You can set a minimum and maximum size; allowed resized increments (e.g.

//! min_width/min_height/max_width/max_height may be set to -1, and it will
//! substitute the size request of the window or geometry widget.  If the
//! minimum size hint is not provided, it will use its requisition as the

//! If setting is true, then destroying the transient parent of this window
//! will also destroy the window itself.  This is useful for dialogs that

+GTK2.Widget get_focus();
//! Retrieves the current focused widget within the window.  Note that this is

void set_focus(GTK2.Widget child);
//! If child is not the current focus widget, and is focusable, sets it as the
//! focus widget for the window.  If child is 0, unsets the focus widget for

void set_default(GTK2.Widget child);
//! The default widget is the widget that's activated when the user presses

mapping(string:int) get_position()
//! This function returns the position you need to pass to move() to keep this

//! returned value varies with window gravity.
//! <p>
//! If you haven't changed the window gravity, its gravity will be
//! GDK2.GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST.  This means that get_position() gets the position
//! of the top-left corner of the window manager frame for the window.  move()
//! sets the position of this same top-left corner.
//! <p>
//! get_position() is not 100% reliable because X does not specify a way to
//! obtain the geometry of the decorations placed on a window by the window
//! manager.  Thus GTK+ is using a "best guess" that works with most window
//! managers.
//! <p>
//! Moreover, nearly all window managers are historically broken with respect
//! to their handling of window gravity.  So moving a window to its current
//! position as returned by get_position() tends to result in moving the window
//! slightly.  Window managers are slowly getting better over time.
//! <p>
//! If a window has gravity GDK2.GRAVITY_STATIC the window manager frame is not
//! relevant, and thus get_position() will always produc accurate results.
//! However you can't use static gravity to do things like place a window in a
//! corner of the screen, because static gravity ignores the window manager
//! decorations.
//! <p>
//! If you are saving and restoring your application's window positions, you
//! should know that it's impossible for applications to do this without
//! getting it somewhat wrong because applications do not have sufficient
//! knowledge of window manager state.

//! which point on the window is position at the reference point.
//! <p>

//! simply the x,y supplied to move().  The top-left corner of the window

//! to position a window at the top left of the screen, you want to use the
//! default gravity (which is GDK2.GRAVITY_NORTH_WEST) and move the window to
//! 0,0.
//! <p>
//! To position a window at the bottom right corner of the screen, you would
