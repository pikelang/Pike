/* The basic IDEA transformation

 *
 * Only primitive operations are done here, chaining modes etc
 * are implemented in a higher level program.

 **********************************************************************
 *
 *    idea.c - C source code for IDEA block cipher.
 *      IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm), formerly known as
 *      IPES (Improved Proposed Encryption Standard).
 *      Algorithm developed by Xuejia Lai and James L. Massey, of ETH Zurich.
 *      This implementation modified and derived from original C code
 *      developed by Xuejia Lai.
 *      Zero-based indexing added, names changed from IPES to IDEA.
 *      CFB functions added.  Random number routines added.
 *
 *      Extensively optimized and restructured by Colin Plumb.
