<chapter title="Preprocessor">

<p>Before the Pike code is sent to the compiler it is fed through the
preprocessor. The preprocessor converts the source code from its
character encoding into the Pike internal representation, performs
some simple normalizations and consistency checks and executes the
"preprocessor directives" that the programmer may have put into the
file. The preprocessor directives are like a very simple programming
language that allows for simple code generation and manipulation.
The code preprocessor can be called from within Pike with the
<ref>cpp</ref> call.</p>

<section title="Charset Heuristics">

<p>Pike code is Unicode enabled, so the first thing the preprocessor
has to do is to try to determine the character encoding of the file.
It will first look at the two first bytes of the file and interpret
them according to this chart.</p>

<matrix>
<r><c><b>Byte 0</b></c><c><b>Byte 1</b></c><c><b>Interpretation</b></c></r>
<r><c>0</c><c>0</c><c>32bit wide string.</c></r>
<r><c>0</c><c>&gt;0</c><c>16bit Unicode string.</c></r>
<r><c>&gt;0</c><c>0</c><c>16bit Unicode string in reverse byte order.</c></r>
<r><c>0xfe</c><c>0xff</c><c>16bit Unicode string.</c></r>
<r><c>0xff</c><c>0xfe</c><c>16bit Unicode string in reverse byte order.</c></r>
<r><c>0x7b</c><c>0x83</c><c>EBCDIC-US ("#c").</c></r>
<r><c>0x7b</c><c>0x40</c><c>EBCDIC-US ("# ").</c></r>
<r><c>0x7b</c><c>0x09</c><c>EBCDIC-US ("#\t").</c></r>
</matrix>

<ul>
<li>With any other combination of bytes the preprocessor will assume
iso-8859-1 encoding until a #charset directive has been found.</li>
<li>The file must be an multiple of 4 or 2 bytes in order to be correctly
decoded as 32bit or 16bit wide string.</li>
<li>It's an error for a program written in EBCDIC not to start with a
#charset directive.</li>
<li>Obfuscation note: It is possible to encode the #charset directive in
EBCDIC and the rest of the file in any other charset stated in the
#charset directive.</li>
</ul>

</section>

<section title="Whitespace Normalization">

<p>The preprocessor collapses all consecutive white space characters
except for newlines single space characters. All // and /**/ comments
are removed, as is #! lines. Pike considers ANSI/DEC escape sequences
as white spaces and will thus be disregarded from. Supported formats
are &lt;ESC&gt;[\040-\077]+[\100-\177] and
&lt;CSI&gt;[\040-\077]*[\100-\177]. Note that this means that it is
possible to do color markup in the actual source file.</p>

<p>The preprocessor will treat seven consecutive &gt; characters
outside of a string as an CVS conflict error and will return "CVS
conflict detected."</p>

</section>

<section title="Defines and Macros">

<p>Defining macros or constants is one of the most used preprocessor
features. It enables you to make abstractions on a code generation
level as well as altering constants cross-application. The simplest
use of the #define directive however is to declare a "define" as
present.</p>

<example>
#define DO_OVERSAMPLING
</example>

<p>The existence of this definition can now be used by e.g. #ifdef and
#ifndef to activate or deactivate blocks of program code.</p>

<example>
#ifdef DO_OVERSAMPLING
  // This code is not always run.
  img->render(size*4)->shrink(4);
#endif
</example>

<p>Note that defines can be given to pike at execution time. In order
to set DO_OVERSAMPLING from a command line, the option
-DDO_OVERSAMPLING is added before the name of the pike program. E.g.
<tt>pike -DDO_OVERSAMPLING my_program.pike</tt>.</p>

<p>A define can also be given a specific value, which will be inserted
everywhere the define is placed in the source code.</p>

<example>
#define CYCLES 20

void do_stuff() {
  for(int i; i&lt;CYCLES; i++) do_other_stuff();
}
</example>

<p>Finally #define can also be used to define macros. Macros are just
text expansion with arguments, but it is often very useful to make a
cleaner looking code and to write less.</p>

<example>
#define VAR(X) id-&gt;:misc-&gt;variable[X]
#define ROL(X,Y) (((X)&lt;&lt;(Y))&amp;7+((X)&gt;&gt;(8-(Y))))
#define PLACEHOLDER(X) void X(mixed ... args) { \
  error("Method " #X " is not implemented yet.\n"); }
#define ERROR(X,Y ...) werror("MyClass" X "\n", Y)
#define NEW_CONSTANTS(X) do{ int i=sizeof(all_constants()); \
    X \
    werror("Constant diff is %d\n", sizeof(all_constants())-i); \
  }while(0)
#define MY_FUNC(X,Y) void my##X##Y()
</example>

<ul>
<li>A macro can have up to 255 arguments.</li>
<li>It can be wise to put extra parenthesis around the arguments
expension since it is a purely textual expansion. I.e. if the macro
DOUBLE(X) is defined as X*2, then DOUBLE(2+3) will produce 2+3*2.</li>
<li>A backslash (\) can be used to make the definition span several
lines.</li>
<li>A hash (#) in front of a macro variable "casts" it to a string.</li>
<li>It is possible to define macros with a variable list of arguments
by using the ... syntax.</li>
<li>Macros are often formulated so that a semicolon after it is
apropriate.</li>
<li>In Pike code macros and defines are most often written in all caps.</li>
<li>If a macro expands into several expressions it is often safest to
group them together in a bigger block, such as do-while(0).</li>
<li>A double hash (##) in front of a macro variable concatenates it with
the text before it.</li>
</ul>

<section title="Preprocessor Directives">

<p>All the preprocessor directives should be at the beginning of the
line. Although indentation is allowed currently, it is possible that
it will generate warnings or errors in the future. It is however
allowed to put spaces after the hash character to create indentation
in code.</p>

<subsection title="#!">
<p>All lines beginning with #! will be regarded as comments, to enable
shell integration. It is recommended that Pike applications begin with
the line "#! /bin/env pike" for maximum cross platform
compatibility.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection title="#&lt;integer&gt;">
<p>A hash character followed by a number will make the preprocessor
line counter set this number as the line number for the current line
and adjust the following lines accordingly. All error messages from
Pike will use these line numbers. Optionally the number may be
followed by a file name, e.g. <tt>#1
"/home/pike/program.pike.in"</tt>. Then this filename will be used
instead of the current file for error messages.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection title="#line">
<p>Works just as the #&lt;integer&gt; preprocessor directive above.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection title='#""'>
<p>If a string literal is opened with #" newlines in the string will
end up in the string literal, instead of triggering a "neline in
string" error. Newlines will be converted to \n characters if the
newlines in the file is something else. This preprocessor directive
may appear anywhere a string may appear.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection title="#string">
<p>The preprocessor #string will load the file in the string that
follows and insert its contents as a string. This preprocessor
directive may appear anywhere a string may appear.</p>
<example>
do_something(#string "the_file.wks");
</example>
