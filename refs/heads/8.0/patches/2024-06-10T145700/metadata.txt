Multiple fixes:

• SSL.File: Automatically write packets after accept(data)

• Protocols.HTTP: Updated the set of known status codes.

The set of status codes should now be up to date with
http://www.iana.org/assignments/http-status-codes/http-status-codes.txt .

Also adds the enum StatusCode for grouping the status codes and
autodoc markup with rfc references for all the symbols.

• Protocols.HTTP: Added status code 421 from RFC 7540.

• Image.PS: Fix fallback to /bin/sh -c gs.

This has been broken since the initial version of the module.
Note that the most likely cause for the fallback being triggered
is that the gs binary is missing, so it is unlikely to improve
anything in practise.
