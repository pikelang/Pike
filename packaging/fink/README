Pike and Nettle Fink package for MacOS X



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
What is it?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fink (http://fink.sf.net/) is a Debian-like packaging system for darwin/MacOS X



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Last version
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The last version of this package will be in Pike 7.6 CVS.
Informations about this package can be found online:
http://bertrand.gotpike.org/



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
How to use that?
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

First, you need to have Fink installed and running. See http://fink.sf.net/

Basically, you'll have to build the package yourself, and keep in mind that 
Pike packages require Nettle package for being built: even if you don't plan
to install pike7.6-nettle later, you need to build Nettle first.
If that's a problem, see the "Hacking" section.

While Nettle packages have been asked (and reviewed) to be included in the
official Fink distribution, it hasn't been included for now, so you'll need 
the nettle.info file.
The Pike 7.6 packages hasn't been asked for review by the Fink team, yet.

Place all the required files (nettle.info pike7.6.info pike7.6.patch) in your 
local repository: /sw/fink/dists/local/main/finkinfo/

Then use the following command for building Pike:

sudo fink -b build pike7.6

This command will build Nettle and Pike packages. The -b flag will try to use
the binary distribution as much as possible, so that you won't have to compile
all the dependencies, only Pike and Nettle.
Once build, you'll have to install the compiled packages. For limiting the need
to external packages, the Pike7.6 is splitted into subpackages. You can list 
them using the command:

sudo fink list pike7.6

Thus, if you want to deal with MySQL with your Pike, just install using the 
following:

sudo fink -b install pike7.6 pike7.6-mysql

If you ant to be able to deal with JPEG later, just use:

sudo fink -b install pike7.6-jpeg



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Compatibility
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The pike7.6 Fink packages has been made so that it won't conflict with pike7.2
or pike7.4 Fink packages.
However, i'm not sure wether pike7.2 nor pike7.4 won't mess up the pike7.6
package.

These packages have been tested on MacOS X 10.4.4 (darwin 8.4.0) using
Fink 0.24.10 (0.8.0.rsync) and gcc 4.0.0 20041026



-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
Hacking
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

If you want to cook your Pike package yourself, just edit the info and patch 
files.
Once your custom changes are made, increment the Revision field and rebuild the
package.

You can use the -k and -K flags for fink, so that you can easily track down any
problem at configure/compile time.

If you add something usefull in the Pike package, please share.
