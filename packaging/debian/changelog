pike7.3 (7.3.62-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * lib/modules/Tools.pmod/AutoDoc.pmod/DocParser.pmod: Fixed broken
          support for typedef.
        * src/modules/Gz/module.pmod.in: Now supports zlib's which lack the
          eof() function.
        * src/modules/Gz/module.pmod.in: Now behaves if zlib isn't
          available.
        * src/builtin_functions.c: Moved some debug functions to Debug.
          Updated sleep doc. Fixed describe_backtrace type.
        * src/builtin.cmod: Move _describe_program to
          Debug.describe_program.
        * src/modules/Gz/testsuite.in: Added test for Gz.File().
        * lib/modules/MIME.pmod/module.pmod: When doing guessy style MIME
          decoding, inherit the guess attribute for multipart message parts.
        * src/modules/Gz/zlibmod.c: Fixed nasty null-termination bug.
        * src/post_modules/Shuffler/Shuffler.cmod: Patched Shuffler module
          some more. This patch should fix some of the problems with the
          shuffler accessing references that have been destructed.
        * lib/modules/Filesystem.pmod/Tar.pmod: Bugfix: Since lookups are
          done with normalized paths, we need to normalize the paths in
          filename{s,_to_entry} as well to get proper matches.
        * src/pike_memory.h: Added a macro to detect whether a memory
          checker is in use, so that conflicting debug checks can be avoided.
        * lib/master.pike.in, src/svalue.c,
          lib/modules/Tools.pmod/testsuite.in: Make %O default output for
          objects and programs better.
        * lib/modules/Stdio.pmod/module.pmod, src/modules/files/file.c,
          src/modules/files/termios.c: Document the low level I/O functions
          in Stdio.File and not Fd.
          .
          Designwise motivation: Fd and Fd_ref ought to be considered
          internal; Stdio.File is the lowest "official" API level.
          .
          Practical motivation: It's _much_ easier to find the functions in
          the generated docs, despite the small pointer to Fd in Stdio.File.
        * lib/modules/Protocols.pmod/HTTP.pmod/Server.pmod/SSLPort.pike:
          added SSL support to the simple webserver. Based on SSL.https, but
          behaves exactly like Protocols.HTTP.Server.Port, except for SSL.
        * lib/master.pike.in: - Changed some search(x,y)!=-1 into
          has_value(x,y) - Optimized Getopt call by using local variables for
          NO_ARG,   MAY_HAVE_ARG and HAS_ARG.  - Optimized Getopt call by
          always having five elements per argument,   so that Getopt need not
          rewrite the array.  - Always accept the --autoreload option so that
          we are silenty  ignoring it if Pike has not autoreload (instead of
          bailing out with strange error messages (that changes depending
          on the number and   order of options)).

pike7.3 (7.3.60-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest cvs snapshot. The most important changes:
        * lib/modules/Protocols.pmod/HTTP.pmod/module.pmod: Added missing
          file argument for put_url().
        * lib/modules/Array.pmod: CHANGES says that there should be an
          Array.Iterator.  So let's have one.
        * lib/modules/Parser.pmod/XML.pmod/DOM.pmod: Added iterators, nice
          _sprintf to Nodes, and made all lfuns static.
        * src/post_modules/Shuffler/Shuffler.cmod: If the done-callback
          destroyed the shuffler object, the shuffler crashed when signaling
          that data wasn't sent thru the give_back function. This might have
          other implications but seems to work as a fix for now.

pike7.3 (7.3.60-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * src/code/: ppc32.c, ppc32.h: Implemented OPCODE_INLINE_BRANCH
	  interface for PPC.
        * src/dlopen.c: Some more IA64 fixes.
        * lib/modules/Protocols.pmod/HTTP.pmod/Query.pike: added the
          possibility to have array values in headers mapping to allow
          multiple headers
        * src/dlopen.c: The IA64 global offset table is now at the end of
          the datasegment, so that gp-relative offsets have a chance at
          working.
        * lib/modules/Standards.pmod/RDF.pike: Improved API and working
          N-triple parsing.
        * src/threads.c: Added a reference from MutexKey to the mutex
          object it holds, so that the latter won't be refcount garbed (which
          causes both to be destructed) if there are no other references.

pike7.3 (7.3.58-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Removed the sybase module as it doesn't work on Debian.

pike7.3 (7.3.58-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest CVS snapshot.

 -- Marek Habersack <grendel@debian.org>  Mon, 21 Oct 2002 03:01:06 +0200

pike7.3 (7.3.58-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * lib/modules/Parser.pmod/XML.pmod/Tree.pmod: Better typing.
        * lib/modules/Array.pmod: Fixed a border problem in Array.sum
        * src/builtin.cmod: Fixed leak of the strings "string" and "int".
        * lib/modules/String.pmod/module.pmod: Removed the deprecated
          strmult and String_buffer (compatibility is already in place).
          Fixed a soundex bug. Made int2roman and int2size throw an error
          when input is out of range. Fixed an off by one error for the
          bytes/kb transition in int2size.
        * lib/modules/Parser.pmod/Pike.pmod: Parse binary numbers.
        * lib/modules/Standards.pmod/EXIF.pmod: Better EXIF support. Some
          API changes: get_properties only accepts Stdio.File objects.
          MN_Multi1 is renamed to MN_Multi3.
        * src/: builtin.cmod, builtin_functions.c: It's better to throw
          errors than return zero if ctime(), localtime() or gmtime() fails.
        * src/builtin.cmod: Fixed missing checks for NULL from gmtime(2),
          localtime(2) and ctime(2) which could cause segfaults. E.g. on NT
          they don't handle negative time stamps.
        * src/modules/: HTTPLoop/log.c, Oracle/oracle.c, spider/discdate.c:
          Fixed missing checks for NULL from gmtime(2), localtime(2) and
          ctime(2) which could cause segfaults. E.g. on NT they don't handle
          negative time stamps.
        * src/builtin_functions.c: Fixed missing checks for NULL from
          gmtime(2) and localtime(2) which could cause segfaults. E.g. on NT
          they don't handle negative time stamps.
        * lib/modules/Remote.pmod/connection.pike: Fixed races that could
          cause synchronous calls to hang in threaded mode.  It's still
          unclear whether a connection close is handled cleanly, though. 
          Better handling of exceptions from close callbacks.

pike7.3 (7.3.56-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest CVS snapshot.

 -- Marek Habersack <grendel@debian.org>  Fri, 18 Oct 2002 01:37:36 +0200

pike7.3 (7.3.56-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * src/: docode.c, interpret_functions.h: Replaced the F_THROW_ZERO
          opcode used at normal exit from catch blocks with F_EXIT_CATCH,
          which uses the newer escape catch feature. This avoids a longjmp at
          the normal exit of every catch block.
          Also changed the return value for normal catch block exits to be
          UNDEFINED and not zero.
        * lib/modules/Parser.pmod/C.pmod: Added index possibility on
          tokens.
        * src/program.c: Use safe_apply_handler for calling
          get_default_module, to get better checking of the return value and
          to get correct handling of return values that are false.
          This fixes a bug in the odd recursion that involves the compat
          handler and e.g. lib/7.2/modules/__default.pmod which itself
          contains "#pike 7.2": The second time get_default_module is called
          it'll resolve an unfinished program with "__default" and thus get a
          function pointer that evaluates to false.
        * bin/pike.in, src/Makefile.in, src/builtin_functions.c,
          src/error.c: Set a breakpoint on pike_gdb_breakpoint by default
          when gdb is started. Made it accessible from pike with
          "_gdb_breakpoint" to make it convenient to enter gdb at a specific
          point in the pike code.

pike7.3 (7.3.55-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * src/modules/Gz/: configure.in, zlibmod.c: The Gz module now
          supports old versions of zlib again.  Most notably seek(), tell(),
          eof() and setparams() are now optionally implemented in Gz._file.
        * lib/master.pike.in: Added include_prefix.
        * src/builtin_functions.c: More information about the use and
          limits of mktime().
        * src/main.c: Now calls tzset() to initialize timezone et al.
        * lib/modules/Protocols.pmod/LDAP.pmod/client.pike: add catch to
          prevent search from bombing out when talking to active directory
          servers. this is not a good fix, as the cause seems to be referrer
          data.
          This will need to be looked at more closely, but it at least allows
          us to talk to m$ systems.
        * lib/modules/Protocols.pmod/LDAP.pmod/client.pike: fixed create()
          so that connection is actually made when SSL support is not
          present.
        * lib/master.pike.in: Added -x option to run tools from 
	  Tools.Standalone.

pike7.3 (7.3.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Latest upstream version. The most important changes:
        * src/modules/Perl/perlmod.c: Adjustment to work better with Perl
          5.8.0, plus a few minor layout changes to make the code nicer to
          read.
        * lib/modules/Local.pmod: Added support for specifying paths using
          the PIKE_LOCAL_PATH environment variable.
        * src/language.yacc: Fixed typing for intranges with bignum
          intervals.
        * lib/modules/Stdio.pmod/GZipFile.pike: Added basic support for
          reading and writing gzip files.  This is the first version and it
          is still a bit experimental.  Uses Gz._file() for lowlevel support.
        * src/modules/Gz/zlibmod.c: Added basic support for reading and
          writing gzip files.  Lowlevel functions are located in Gz._file().
        * src/builtin_functions.c: Fixed incorrect info about rusage() and
          added a bit more description about some of the items.
        * src/language.yacc: Added the "global" keyword to
          magic_identifiers so it can be used after ->.
        * src/pike_types.c: parse_type() now supports the syntax
          object(this_program), and defaults to implements mode.
        * src/modules/Postgres/: configure.in, pgres_config.h.in,
          postgres.c: this makes the Postgres module detect/work correctly
          with the PostgreSQL 7.2+
