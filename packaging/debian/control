Description: Powerful interpreted programming language
 Pike is an interpreted, object-oriented, dynamic programming language
 with a syntax similar to C. It includes many powerful data types and
 a module system that, for instance, provides image manipulation together,
 with support for graphics formats like SVG, JPG, PNG, GIF, XCF and many
 others,  database connectivity, advanced cryptography, XML/HTML parsers
 and others. To learn more about pike, please visit http://pike.ida.liu.se/
 Note that some of the  Pike features are found in other pike7.7-* packages 
 (image processing, mysql, postgresql, sane and more).
