The files in this directory:

export.pike
  Creates a Pike source distribution.

extract.pike
  Locale extraction utility for the locate system
  implemented in the Locale module.

fake_dynamic_load.pike

fixdepends.sh

hilfe
  Alias for pike without arguments, which starts Hilfe,
  the incremental Pike frontend.

install_module
  Installs a Pike module into a pike module directory.
  [FIXME: Doesn't appear to be fully functional]

install.pike
  The Pike installation script, which is run when a
  Pike is installed. It is also run by when a binary
  export is made, to assemble the package it later will
  install.

make_ci.pike
  Creates the file case_info.h during Pike build. The
  case_info.h file is an optimized version of the case
  information in the ../src/UnicodeData.txt file.

make_interpret_functions.pike
  Creates the file interpret_functions_fixed.h during
  Pike build.

metatest
  Utility that permutates over a number of configure
  flags and compiles and verifies all the produced Pikes.
  [FIXME: Update with more interesting flags?]

mkpackage.pike
  Utility for creating executable installation scripts
  based on Pike. [FIXME: Better description.]

mkpeep.pike
  Creates the file peep_engine.c during Pike build.

mktestsuite
  Generates testsuite files from testsuite.in files
  during "make verify".

mktreeopt.pike
  Creates the file mktreeopt.h during Pike build.

nobinary_dummy
  A simple script that fakes success for all configure
  tests when --disable-binary is set.

parse_install_log
  [FIXME: What does this do? Doesn't appear to be called
   from any Makefile.]

pike
  This file is generated from the file pike.in when make
  all is built from the top level make file. This script
  is a wrapper for the latest built Pike binary that

  bin/pike --gdb program_that_crash.pike --arg arg2

pike.in
  The file from which the script pike is generated.

precompile.pike
  Creates .c files from .cmod files during Pike build.

rsif

smartlink
  [FIXME: What does this do?]

tarfilter.pike
  Filters a tar file applying root/root ownership on
  its contents.

test_pike.pike
  The program that performs the test suite when make
  verify is run.

unbug
  A GDB frontend for debugging pike code.

xenofarm.sh
  Generates a Xenofarm result package if run in a Xenofarm build
  package.

xenofarm_gdb_cmd
  GDB commands that the Xenofarm client will run on any resulting core
  files once its build and verification is done.
